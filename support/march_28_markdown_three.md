## Week 3
### Monday
- What we’ll learn today: *At it’s heart a ruby gem is just ruby code! Utilizing gems can help you build your applications more quickly and more efficiently. You can even build your own gem for code you will utilize in multiple applications.  Understanding how to elegantly display tabular data will help you as you build user dashboards or display data such as inventories.*

### Tuesday
- What we’ll learn today: *Authorization is a way of granting permissions to different users in your application. You wouldn’t want customers to be able to update inventory values, or users to edit your blog content.  The Petergate gem will help you integrate this authorization.  In Ruby we will take a look at the Hash data structure and how the key value pairs make parsing data so much more flexible.  We will also take a discover even more ways to present tabular data with HTML styling.*

### Wednesday
- What we’ll learn today: *Today we will being to implement styling into our project using the Bootstrap Framework. We can use a template as a jumping off point for our three layouts to get us started more quickly. In Ruby we will address Conditionals.  Conditionals allow programs to make decisions based on varying data (eg: If the user is not logged in they can not leave comments on the blog). Our time with HTML will focus on forms. User friendly forms make for a better user experience.*

### Thursday
- What we’ll learn today: *There are certain expectations that savvy users want and expect in their apps that are limited if we only use Rails, HTML, and CSS.  Javascript functions and modules add more interaction and a heightened user experience to our apps. In Ruby we will dive in to OOP(object oriented programming). OOP makes applications scalable and editable. Your front-end objective today will be to recreate the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS without a guide! This will process will help you to be thinking like a developer.*
