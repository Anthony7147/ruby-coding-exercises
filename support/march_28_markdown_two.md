## Week 2
### Monday
- What we’ll learn today: *Our focus will be on the Model (M of our MVC framework).  The model represents data. Understanding how to create relationships with our models is vital to the process of requesting information from the database.  Ruby methods are important building blocks that will be found throughout your applications. They are used to create functionality.  Web developer tools allow you to quickly manipulate your CSS to see changes in real time.*

### Tuesday
- What we’ll learn today: *Authentication is the process that allows a user to register, login, and logout of an application. In Ruby we will focus on process and lambdas and how lambdas might be the better choice for capturing the data we want.  For front end design we will discover how classes can help you reuse your code and the limits of ids.*

### Wednesday
- What we’ll learn today: *Controllers (the C of MVC framework)  are essentially a ruby class  that store a series of actions (methods) that need to be performed.  Controllers manage our data by communicating with the routing engine of our app. (Controllers make sure there is Blog data in your blog page and not your about page). Our Ruby focus will be loops and how they easily apply the same code to multiple items.  CSS (cascading style sheets) will introduce you to ways you can give your app a unique look and feel.*
