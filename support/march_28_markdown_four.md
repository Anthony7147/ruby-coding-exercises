## Week 4
### Monday
- What we’ll learn today: *Rails is all about data flow, and a piece of that is capturing data.  We will take a comprehensive look at forms from both a Rails and Javascript perspective.  We will cover the Ruby file system. This is good practical knowledge on how to store data so you don’t have to rely on a database connection every time.  We will also review the goal of error handling. Your mission today will be to create a clone of the Pinterest home page. Knowing how to use icons and more detailed styling will further enhance the look of your designs.*

### Tuesday
- What we’ll learn today: *As you become a more seasoned developer you will begin the use the lib directory (library) more and more.  It is a place to store custom modules that can be used through the rest of your app. By placing these modules in the lib you will  isolate them, which protects your application from buggy behavior.  In Ruby we will take a look at regular expressions and how they can help us capture valid data. We will also discover the benefits of grep when searching through collections.  We will rev up our css course work by cloning the Tesla home page.*

### Wednesday
- What we’ll learn today: *Rails 5 has given us an exciting new feature called Action Cable.  It gives us the ability to use share live data in a much easier way than ever before.  Understanding how to implement this powerful component will give your app serious street cred. In Ruby we will take a look at researching gems  and introduce a lightweight alternative to Rails.  Knowing how to build HTML emails, will  give you the ability to create custom emails that can be sent from your app.*
